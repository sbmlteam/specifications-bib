     ABSTRACT = {
The investigation and modeling of gene regulatory networks requires
computational tools specific to the task. We present several locally
developed software tools that have been used in support of our ongoing
research into the embryogenesis of the sea urchin. These tools are
especially well suited to iterative refinement of models through
experimental and computational investigation. They include: BioArray, a
macroarray spot processing program; SUGAR, a system to display and
correlate large-BAC sequence analyses; SeqComp and FamilyRelations,
programs for comparative sequence analysis; and NetBuilder, an environment
for creating and analyzing models of gene networks. We also present an
overview of the process used to build our model of the Strongylocentrotus
purpuratus endomesoderm gene network. Several of the tools discussed in
this paper are still in active development and some are available as open
source.}
